See top level README for info on documentation and tools.

This is my second implementation of the
Ridiculously Simple Computer.  The instruction set is defined here:

http://www.eng.umd.edu/~blj/RiSC/

I also have a repo myrisc with tools and a simulator.

I removed the "memory" and the load and replace store with store whatever
to the led register.  so it fits and blinks the led, you can change
the program (well...can figure out a way to, not difficult) to change
the blink rate or pattern, etc.
