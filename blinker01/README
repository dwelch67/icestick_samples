This is a super simple example.  Just a 32 bit counter (likely optimized
to fewer bits) where some of the bits are output to the leds on the
icestick.

        LED1 = XCOUNT[21];
        LED2 = XCOUNT[22];
        LED3 = XCOUNT[23];
        LED4 = XCOUNT[24];
        LED5 = XCOUNT[25];

you can run make to build and/or make prog to build and load.  If you
dont want to mess with cdl, then dont touch the cdl file just the verilog
file and the make will work from that.

The green led blinks about once every 3 seconds perhaps.  But you can
see that it is working, if you dont get blinking leds, then stop here
and figure out why.

Next I did this

        LED1 = XCOUNT[27];
        LED2 = XCOUNT[28];
        LED3 = XCOUNT[29];
        LED4 = XCOUNT[30];
        LED5 = XCOUNT[31];

the first led changes state about every 11 seconds, so 2^27/11 is 12
million.  2^27/12 million is a smidge over 11 seconds. so that sounds
like the input clock to this verilog is a 12Mhz clock.  Good to know.

Also from this we can see which led is which between the code and the
layout of the board.
